# Welcome üëã

Hey there! I'm <b>Karan Pratap Singh</b> ‚Äî a tech enthusiast who loves diving into <b>Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Data Engineering, and Data Analysis</b>. When I‚Äôm not building data pipelines or fine-tuning models, you‚Äôll probably find me <b>playing guitar üé∏, hiking up a trail ü•æ, or experimenting with something delicious in the kitchen üç≥</b>.

## Highlights

üåê **Global Experience:** I have contributed to impactful projects in the United States and India, bringing a diverse perspective to problem-solving and leveraging global insights.

üîç **Data Science Impact:** Demonstrated success in data science roles, including developing a proprietary Generative AI tool, implementing a Customer Escalation prediction framework, and analyzing Overall Customer Experience KPIs, resulting in significant improvements and cost savings.

üîç **Data Engineering Impact:** Designed and deployed scalable data pipelines across cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP), integrated batch and real-time ETL workflows, optimized data models and query performance, and enabled reliable analytics and AI use cases.

üéπ **Extracurricular Passions:** I enjoy hiking and vibing to good music.

üåê **Open to Opportunities:** Currently located in Dallas, TX, and open to relocation for compelling career opportunities that align with my passion for data science, data engineering and AI.
